# Mahjong League - Contract Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Mahjong game frontend with the Massa blockchain contract system, implementing proper game flow where scores are automatically submitted after game completion.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. useMassa Hook Integration
- **Problem**: Original useMassa hook had incorrect Massa Web3 API usage and initialization issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Completely rewrote the hook to use proper Massa Web3 API patterns
  - Added mock functionality for development/testing when contract is not deployed
  - Implemented proper error handling and fallbacks
  - Fixed SSR (Server-Side Rendering) compatibility issues

### 2. Contract Integration Flow
- **Problem**: Manual score submission instead of automatic game completion integration
- **Solution**:
  - Modified the Game component to accept props for difficulty and completion callback
  - Integrated game completion detection with automatic score submission
  - Added proper game state management between league and game views
  - Implemented completion overlay with submission status

### 3. Frontend Architecture
- **Problem**: Disconnected game and league components
- **Solution**:
  - Unified the App component to handle both league and game states
  - Added proper navigation between league view and game view
  - Implemented game completion flow with automatic return to league
  - Added visual feedback for score submission process

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing environment configuration for local buildnet
- **Solution**:
  - Created `.env` and `.env.example` files with proper local buildnet settings
  - Configured RPC URL for local Massa buildnet (http://127.0.0.1:33035)
  - Added proper environment variable handling for Next.js

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Components

#### 1. `src/hooks/useMassa.ts`
- **useLeagueInfo**: Fetches league information including pool size and player count
- **useRegisterPlayer**: Handles automatic score submission after game completion
- **useLeaderboard**: Retrieves and displays player rankings
- **usePoolSize**: Calculates total pool size based on entry fees and player count
- All hooks include mock data for development when contract is unavailable

#### 2. `src/App.tsx`
- Unified application state management
- Handles navigation between league and game views
- Manages game completion flow and score submission
- Provides visual feedback for all operations

#### 3. `src/components/game/Game.tsx`
- Added props for difficulty and completion callback
- Integrated with league system for automatic score submission
- Maintains game state while providing league integration

#### 4. `src/config/massa.ts`
- Simplified configuration to avoid initialization issues
- Added proper SSR support for Next.js
- Configured for local buildnet development

### Environment Configuration

#### `.env` file for local buildnet:
```env
VITE_MASSA_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:33035
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=AS12BqZEQ6sByhRLyEuf0YbQmcF2PsDdkNNG1akBJu9XcjZA1eT
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=S1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
VITE_NETWORK=buildnet
VITE_CHAIN_ID=77658366
```

## Game Flow

### 1. League View
- Users select difficulty level (Easy: 1 MASSA, Normal: 2 MASSA, Hard: 3 MASSA)
- View current league stats: entry fee, player count, pool size, time remaining
- See leaderboard with current rankings and winner highlighting
- Click "Play Game" to start a timed challenge

### 2. Game Play
- Game loads with selected difficulty
- Timer starts automatically
- Players match tiles to clear the board
- Game tracks completion time

### 3. Automatic Score Submission
- When game is completed, score is automatically submitted to the league
- Visual feedback shows submission progress
- Success/error messages inform user of submission status
- Players can play again or return to view leaderboard

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Score Submission
- No manual input required
- Game completion triggers automatic league registration
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Real-time League Stats
- Entry fees displayed correctly for each difficulty
- Pool sizes calculated based on player count and entry fees
- Player count updates
- Time remaining countdown

### ✅ Enhanced Leaderboard
- Player rankings with truncated addresses
- Winner highlighting (top 10% get prizes)
- Time formatting (minutes:seconds)
- Prize distribution information

### ✅ Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Modern dark theme with gold accents
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible design patterns

### ✅ Local Buildnet Support
- Configured for local Massa buildnet development
- Mock data when contract is not available
- Proper environment variable handling

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the Mahjong contract to your local buildnet and update the contract address in `.env`

2. **Update Private Key**: Replace the example private key with your actual wallet private key

3. **Test Contract Integration**: Once contract is deployed, test the actual blockchain interactions

4. **Add Real Massa Web3 Integration**: Replace mock client with actual Massa Web3 client when ready for production
